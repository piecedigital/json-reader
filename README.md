#JSON Reader

I wrote this algorithm to read JSON objects of unknown length but documented directories.
The idea behind it is that you could use a given path from a URL (e.g., "/some/cool/url/path"), turn it into an array (e.g., ["some", "cool", "url", "path"]), and read or modify an object within a given object.

This has been done before, I'm certain, but I was glad that I came up with it on my own. :D
